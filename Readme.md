## Installation

There is no need to install the app. It is a standalone app. The standalone app is `dist/Calc.exe`.  So just open and it'll run.

Or if you want to run from the 
script, then

- Clone the repo
- Open the terminal or powershell from that folder
- Enter the following command:

    `python main.py`
